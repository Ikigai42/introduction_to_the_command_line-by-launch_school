### 2. As discussed previously in this chapter, the PATH variable determines which files can be executed without specifying their path explicitly. Run through the commands in this exercise to see this principle in action.

`$ OLDPATH=$PATH`

`$ echo $OLDPATH`

`/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin`

## Set the current PATH variable to another variable so we can revert to it later:

`$ cd /usr/local`

`$ ls`

`bin etc games include lib man sbin share src`

`$ PATH="" ls`

`-bash: ls: No such file or directory`

`$ ls`

`bin etc games include lib man sbin share src`
