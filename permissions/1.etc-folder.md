### 1. Which user and group are assigned to the /etc folder on your computer?

## You can find the user and group of the /etc folder by running the following command:

`$ ls -l /`

> The above command will list multiple files and directories, so just find the one for /etc. It should have the user root and probably the group root if you are on linux. If you run the same command on a Mac computer, the group for the /etc folder is probably wheel.
