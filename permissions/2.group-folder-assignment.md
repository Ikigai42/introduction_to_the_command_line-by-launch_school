### 2. Which user and group are assigned to the $HOME folder?

`ls -la /$HOME`

> LS: If you type ls -la $HOME, you'll see a list of all the files and directories in your home folder. It will also show a directory called .. and one called .. Remember that a single . refers to the current directory, so that item is the listing for the $HOME directory. Your user should be its owner, and the group will either be the same name as your user, or staff, if you're on a Mac.

> LS: You could also type ls -la $HOME/.. to list all the files and directories in the /home (Linux) or /Users (Mac) directory. The folder that's named the same as your username is your home directory.
