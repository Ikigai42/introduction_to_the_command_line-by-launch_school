4. One of the most common tasks when using the command line interface is reading the contents of a file. This exercise will go over some common commands for doing so: cat, more, less, head, and tail.

To print out all the contents of a file, use cat:

$ echo "Some example text" > file.txt
$ cat file.txt
All the content of file.txt printed out here.

To print out the first few lines of a file, use head:

$ head /etc/services
#
# Network services, Internet style
#
# Note that it is presently the policy of IANA to assign a single well-known
# port number for both TCP and UDP; hence, most entries here have two entries
# even if the protocol doesn't support UDP operations.
#
# The latest IANA port assignments can be gotten from
#
#	http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers

To print out the last few lines of a file, use tail:

$ tail /etc/services
isnetserv       48128/tcp   # Image Systems Network Services
isnetserv       48128/udp   # Image Systems Network Services
blp5            48129/tcp   # Bloomberg locator
blp5            48129/udp   # Bloomberg locator
#               48130-48555 Unassigned
com-bardac-dw   48556/udp    # com-bardac-dw
com-bardac-dw   48556/tcp    # com-bardac-dw
#                           Nicholas J Howes <nick@ghostwood.org>
#               48557-49150 Unassigned
#               49151       IANA Reserved

To print out the contents of a file, but only fill one screen's worth at a time, use more:

$ more /etc/services
# The first page of /etc/services will show up here, and you can use the
# down arrow to go to the next line, or the space bar to go to the next
# page.

Use less when you need to navigate backward and forward in a file:

less /etc/services
The less command allows you to go forward one line with the down arrow, backward one line with the up arrow, and backward and forward a page with the page up and page down keys. You can also use the space bar in the same way you can with the more command.

Note: to exit more or less, type the q key.
