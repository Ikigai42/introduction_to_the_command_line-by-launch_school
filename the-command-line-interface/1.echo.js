/**1.The echo command has only one optional flag: -n, which means "Do not print the trailing newline character." Experiment with echo. Run the following commands, guessing before running each what the output will be: */

echo "hello world" // => hello world
echo hello world // => hello world
echo -n hello world // => hello world[the-command-line-interface (main)]$
echo hello world -n // => hello world -n
echo "hello world" -n // => hello world -n
echo "-n hello world" // => -n hello world


/**LS
$ echo "hello world"
hello world
$ echo hello world
hello world
$ echo -n hello world
hello world$ echo hello world -n
hello world -n
$ echo "hello world" -n
hello world -n
$ echo "-n hello world"
-n hello world

The above commands illustrate the following ideas:

1-Arguments can be wrapped in quotes, but don't always have to be wrapped.
2-Flags (like -n) usually must come before other arguments. (There are exceptions to this rule.)
3-Misplaced arguments and/or flags change the output.

Also note that on line 17 of the output, the prompt stayed on the same line as the output. This isn't a typo. It's the result of the -n flag being used properly.
