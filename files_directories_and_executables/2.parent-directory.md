# 2.List the files in the parent directory. Then list the files in the parent directory's parent directory.

`ls ../`

`ls ../../`

> LS: You can list a parent directory's files using the following command:
> $ ls ..

> LS: What happens if you run that command from the root directory?
> $ cd /
> $ ls ..
> `bin home lib64 opt sbin usr`
> LS: As you can see, since the root directory doesn't have a parent directory, it just prints out the files in the root directory itself.
> To list the files of the parent's parent directory, just add a slash and an extra ..
> $ cd
> $ ls ../..
