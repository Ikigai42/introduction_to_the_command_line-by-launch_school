# Suppose you have two directories called xyz/ and abc/. How do you move all the files in abc/ that end with ".txt" into xyz/?

`use glob operator * along with ".txt"`
`mv abc/*.txt xyz/`

> LS: Using the glob operator \*, (also known as the wildcard or just asterisk) you can move all files that match a particular pattern. First, check your pattern:
> `$ ls abc/*.txt` returns `1.txt 2.txt 3.txt`

> Then move the files:
> `$ mv abc/*.txt xyz/`
