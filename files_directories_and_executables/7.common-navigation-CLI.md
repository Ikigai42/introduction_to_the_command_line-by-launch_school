# Let's review some common navigation tasks:

### To get your current location, use pwd:`

> $ pwd
> /home/ubuntu

### To change your current directory, use cd. Using it without any arguments will take you to your home directory:`

> $ cd
> $ pwd
> /home/ubuntu

### You can also pass the $HOME variable as an argument, or use the ~ (tilde) as the first argument to achieve the same results:

> $ cd $HOME
> $ pwd
> /home/ubuntu
> $ cd ~
> $ pwd
> /home/ubuntu

### Go to the root directory (/):

> $ cd /
> $ pwd
> /

### Use the ls command to determine what files and directories are located in the current directory:

> $ cd /
> $ pwd
> /
> $ ls
> bin dev home lib64 lost+found mnt proc run selinux sys usr

### Pass a directory or a path as an argument to the cd command to go directly to that location:

> $ cd usr
> $ pwd
> /usr

### You can also get a sneak peek into what directories are located in a specific path:

> $ cd /
> $ pwd
> /
> $ ls usr
> bin etc games include lib lib64 libexec local sbin share src tmp

### Use the -lah set of flags as arguments to the ls command to get more detailed information about files and directories:

> $ cd /
> $ ls -lah
> total 112K
> dr-xr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Mar 16 20:56 .
> dr-xr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Mar 16 20:56 ..
