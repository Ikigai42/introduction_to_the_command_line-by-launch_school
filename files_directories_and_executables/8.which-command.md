# 8. In this exercise we're going to play with executables. We'll find the location of so-called "default executables" by using the `which` command, then execute a file using its absolute path.

### To figure out a default executable's location, you can use the which command:

`$ which touch`
`/bin/touch`

### Now we can execute the `touch` command using its full path or name:

` $ cd`
`$ touch test`
`$ ls`
`test`
`$ /bin/touch test2`
`$ ls`
`test test2`
